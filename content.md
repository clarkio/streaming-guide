# Advice on what to stream about

[15:12] pattyjogal: I wanted to ask: How do you come up with what you want to work with on stream? Do you feel that some projects are better suited for it than others, or does anything work?

What do I stream?

General streaming Advice

- Patience
- Just be yourself
- Keep it simple
  - Don't go buying crazy equipment just yet. First make sure you will stick with this and want to invest in doing it more
- Have a fairly consistent schedule
  - At least one day a week (maybe one day every two weeks)
  - Aim for blocking 3 total hours
    - 30 mins for preparing
    - 2 hours for live streaming
    - 30 mins for post stream decompress
- Stream things you're interested in
  -  if you stream things you're not into you'll lose interest in streaming all together and/or it'll feel more like a chore than fun
- Make your viewers a high priority

## Advice While Streaming

### Security
  - [15:26] da_vaibhav: and turn notifications off or create new user on your OS
    - use a different browser or browser profile to avoid accidentally doxxing yourself
    - have a secrets/brb/some scene to hide your screen when working with any passwords, api keys, etc.
  - Consider using a VPN

### Visibility

EyLuismi: something interesting maybe is to zoom text or different parts of the screen, don't know if you have talked about it

  - making the content visible on small screens and not just large screens
    - think mobile app or browser
