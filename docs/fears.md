This document is intended to try and help get past some fears that may be holding you back from streaming.


### Revealing Sensitive Information


### Can't Share my Work
[22:14] Danthuss: For me the only thing i would be interested in streaming would be what i work on, which im not allowed to stream :(

### Toxicity
[22:15] archification: The main thing that scares me is exposure. I've been on the internet for too long and there's a lot of toxic people out there. I won't have a comminity yet starting out. So there's like this weird thing where I feel like I shouldn't ban people at first for being toxic because then I go from 1 viewer to 0.
