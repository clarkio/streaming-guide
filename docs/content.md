# Advice on what to stream about

[15:12] pattyjogal: I wanted to ask: How do you come up with what you want to work with on stream? Do you feel that some projects are better suited for it than others, or does anything work?

What do I stream?

### Focus
Think about what you enjoy doing most. What is it that you're most interested in? Whatever that is then it could be something to try out doing on stream!


## Interaction
Folks are kind enough to join your stream and on top of that send messages to you in chat so be sure to acknowledge them

## General Streaming Advice

- Confirm the type of stream atmosphere you want to create
- Patience
- Just be yourself
- Keep it simple
  - Don't go buying crazy equipment just yet. First make sure you will stick with this and want to invest in doing it more
- Have a fairly consistent schedule
  - At least one day a week (maybe one day every two weeks)
  - Aim for blocking 3 total hours
    - 30 mins for preparing
    - 2 hours for live streaming
    - 30 mins for post stream decompress
- Stream things you're interested in
  - if you stream things you're not into you'll lose interest in streaming all together and/or it'll feel more like a chore than fun
- Make your viewers a high priority
- Listen to feedback from your viewers

## Advice While Streaming

### Security
  - Turn notifications off or create new user on your OS
    - use a different browser or browser profile to avoid accidentally doxxing yourself
    - have a secrets/brb/some scene to hide your screen when working with any passwords, api keys, etc.
  - Consider using a VPN

### Visibility

EyLuismi: something interesting maybe is to zoom text or different parts of the screen, don't know if you have talked about it

  - making the content visible on small screens and not just large screens
    - think mobile app or browser
